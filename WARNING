The scripts currently use a repository that I personaly host on a VM on the AWS plateform.
It isn't viable in a long term and has to be changed (a solution may be creating a local repo on the network)


To apply the puppet modules, a new script has been created : easybuild.sh
It HAS TO be executed AFTER the other scripts (at least after puppet.sh and librarian-puppet.sh). Because at the moment I do not know how the order of execution of the scripts is decided during the "rake packer/os:init", I have decided to add it manually.
The steps are the following :
copy easybuild.sh (which is currently stored in the scripts directory) to the scripts directory of the os you're bulding (e.g : packer/{os}/scripts)
add the following line to the end of the "scripts" part in the .json file of the OS :
	"scripts/easybuild.sh"
NB: Do not forget to add the coma at the end of the preceding line.

In the future, it may be interesting to automatize this step, but for that I will have to figure out how to ensure that this new script is going to be executed after the others. (without adding to much specificity (e.g a "final" category which would be executed after the others) because it wouldn't solve the problem as a whole if some day we want to add a new script which should be executed at a precise point).
A viable solution would be to prefix the names of the scripts to give them manually an order, but I have first to be sure that the order is the alphabetical order.
